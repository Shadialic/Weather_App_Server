Here is the instruction:-

Technologies used:-

During the creation of the weather app, I used technologies such as Vite and React for the frontend, and Tailwind CSS for styling. For the backend,
I used Node.js and the ORM tool Prisma with a PostgreSQL database.

Features includes:-

User Registration & Authentication: Secure user registration and login with JWT-based authentication.
Current Weather: Get real-time weather updates for any city.
Weather Forecast: View weather forecasts for the upcoming days.
Historical Weather Data: Access past weather records for various cities.
Favorite Cities: Add or remove cities from your list of favorites for quick access to weather information.

Api Used :- openWeatherMap (for the weather data's)

Initial setup: -

1- Clone the Repository
➱Backend:- https://github.com/Shadialic/Weather_App_Server
Clone this both frontend and backend into a single folder. I recommend you to open this in any open source code editor like Visual Studio Code.
Please ensure that Both backend and frontend running on a split terminal.
2- Setup backend
➱After cloning the project, the name might be a bit complicated so rename it to anything like backend.
➱Navigate to the folder with **cd server** command and install the node package manager with **npm install** command.
➱I added the .env file in the root directory.
➱Apply database migrations using **npx prisma migrate dev** command.
➱ To start the backend server, use **npm start** command.
